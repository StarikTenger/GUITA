# GUITA - GUI vs The Allience

A tower defence, but instead of towers *HTML gui* elements are used

The project was made for the [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-196) with the constraint that everything should by made in 3 hours (however we have spent a bit more). The theme was "Interference does damage", but we misread it as "**Interface** does damage", so gui it is
